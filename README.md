# CCNotes Custom Nodes for ComfyUI 🎨⚡

A powerful and thoughtfully designed collection of custom nodes for ComfyUI, covering **workflow control, image & mask processing, previews, and text utilities**.  
Built to make complex workflows **cleaner, faster, and more controllable**—with just a touch of fun ✨

---

## ✨ Features

- **Image & Mask Processing**  
  Blend, constrain, switch, swap, transform, and scale images and masks with precision and ease.

- **Process & Restore Workflows**  
  Crop images by mask, process them independently, and seamlessly restore them to their original positions—ideal for advanced inpainting pipelines.

- **Text & Numeric Utilities**  
  Perform math operations, concatenate strings, translate and transform text, and display values directly inside your workflow.

- **Inpainting Helpers**  
  Purpose-built nodes for cropping, stitching, extending, and restoring image regions without manual rewiring.

- **Workflow Control & Logic**  
  Powerful logic switches, previews, pauses, and automatic muting nodes that give you fine-grained control over execution flow—while saving compute behind the scenes 😏

## 🌟 Node Highlights

### 🔀 SwitchAnyMute

More than a simple data switch, **SwitchAnyMute** provides **true execution-flow control**.

**Key feature**  
- 💤 **Upstream silence**  
  All unselected inputs keep their *entire upstream node chains fully inactive*. Only the selected branch executes.

**Why it’s awesome**  
- Eliminates unnecessary computation in heavy image or mask pipelines  
- Prevents unintended side effects from inactive branches  
- Makes complex workflows deterministic and easier to debug  
- Enables real conditional execution—like a mini program inside ComfyUI  

**Typical use cases**  
- Prompt / conditioning A–B testing  
- Switching between alternative image or mask processing paths  
- Debugging without deleting or muting nodes manually  
- Building performance-friendly, conditional pipelines  

**One-line summary**  
> **SwitchAnyMute**: Only the selected branch runs—everything else stays muted 😎

### 🔇 AutoMute

Automatically mutes or unmutes nodes or groups based on monitored node states.

**Key feature**  
- 🤖 **Smart auto-control**  
  Target nodes or groups activate only when required and remain silent otherwise.

**Why it’s awesome**  
- Saves compute by preventing unnecessary execution  
- Integrates seamlessly with *Fast Groups Muter*
- Enables reactive, logic-driven workflows without extra wiring  

**Typical use cases**  
- Enable mask-processing groups only when masks are present  
- Keep previews and auxiliary nodes dormant until triggered  
- Build self-managing workflows that adapt automatically  

**One-line summary**  
> **AutoMute**: A silent guardian for your workflow—active only when needed 😎

### 👀 AnyPreviewPause

A versatile node for **previewing data and controlling execution**.

**Key features**
- 🖼️ **Image & mask pairing**
  Automatically pairs connected images and masks for grouped overlay previews (list-supported).  
- ⏸️ **Pause execution**
  Temporarily halt the workflow to tweak masks, prompts, or text before continuing.  
- ✨ **Flexible previews**
  Works with images, masks, and text.

**Why it’s awesome**  
- Inspect intermediate results without breaking the workflow  
- Perfect for interactive inpainting and prompt tuning  
- Makes debugging and experimentation safe and enjoyable  

**One-line summary**
> **AnyPreviewPause**: Preview, pause, and tweak—without losing control 😎
